🌐 HTML Injection 🛠️

HTML Injection is a web security vulnerability where an attacker injects malicious HTML code into a web application. This code is then executed in the context of the user's browser, leading to various harmful outcomes. 😈

🔍 Attack Scenario:

An attacker identifies a vulnerable input field in a web form.
They inject their own HTML code into the input field.
The web application fails to properly sanitize the input, and the injected code is displayed on the page.
When other users visit the page, the injected code runs in their browsers.
⚡ Impact:

Cross-Site Scripting (XSS): Malicious code can steal sensitive user data, perform actions on behalf of the user, or deface the website.
Phishing Attacks: Attackers can create convincing fake login forms to steal credentials.
Browser Exploitation: Malware can be delivered through code execution.
Session Hijacking: Attackers can steal session cookies to impersonate users.
🛡️ Prevention:

Input Validation: Validate and sanitize user input to prevent code execution.
Content Security Policy (CSP): Define which sources of content are allowed to be executed.
Escaping User Input: Encode and escape user-generated content before rendering.
Remember to always practice responsible disclosure and ethical hacking. 💻🔒
